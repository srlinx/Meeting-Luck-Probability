# Probability of Meeting a Random Person Twice in Life

This program calculates the probability of meeting a random person twice in life, given a total population and some assumptions about encounter frequency and duration.

## Usage

To use the program, you can simply run the Python script `main.py`. This will print the probability of meeting a random person twice in life, based on the assumptions in the script.

## Assumptions

The program makes the following assumptions:

- The encounters occur randomly over the course of a lifetime, with an equal chance of occurring at any time.
- We have an average of 1 encounter with the person per month.
- The encounters last for an average of 1 hour each.

## Input

The program uses the following input:

- Total population: The total number of people in the population.
- Encounter frequency: The average number of encounters with the person per month.
- Encounter duration: The average duration of an encounter with the person in hours.

## Output

The program outputs the following:

- Probability of meeting a random person twice in life: The probability of encountering a random person twice in life, based on the assumptions in the program.

## Example

As an example, the current world population is approximately 7.9 billion people. Using the assumptions in the program, the probability of meeting a random person twice in life is calculated to be approximately 0.0000000739.
